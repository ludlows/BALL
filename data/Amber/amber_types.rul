; first tentative rule firl for assigning AMBER and GlyCam atom types. This
; is still *ALPHA* code. Use at your own risk. Use this file with
; BALL/source/APPLICATIONS/UTILITIES/assign_typenames_from_rules.
;
; Some of these rules are directly copied from HyperChem assignment rules.
;
; PLEASE note that this file has only been used on sugars yet, so don't
; expect it to work with proteins too well.
;
; Note that these rules use special atom types for certain properties:
;
; Atom type 'E' means that the atom in focus is more electronegative than
; the one which we are about to give a type. This is the same in HyperChem.
; 
; Atom type 'A' discriminates axially substituted C in sugar rings.
