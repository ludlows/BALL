BALL examples


This directory contains some short examples illustarting some of BALL's
capabilities.
Just type "make" to build the examples. When called without arguments,
each example prints out the required syntax. Please have a look at the
source code od each example.

ramachandran:
=============
 
  This example reads a PDB file and calculates all backbone torsion angles.
  From the output of the program, a Ramachandran plot can be created that
  shows the torsion angle distribution.


MOLVIEWClient:
==============

  This example illustrates the simple visualization using the MolVIEW 
  stand-alone viewer. It reads a PDB file and sends its contents to the
  MolVIEW application running somewhere on the network. On this viewer,
  the molecule is then inserted and drawn in the current representation
  (please make sure, the VIEW server is activated - check the settings in
  Display/Preferences/Network).
