To install BALL it should be sufficient to type the following
commands:

   autoconf                    - to create configure
 
   ./configure                 - to determine your setup

   make                        - to build the library

   make install                - to install the library under BALL/lib

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...  - set the library search path (sh-like shells)
or setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ...                                (csh-like shells)

   make test                   - to build and run the library test suite
                                 (not required, but recommended)

   make BALLView               - to build the stand-alone molecule viewer
                                 (only if you had OpenGL/Mesa and QT installed)

The configuration of the visualization component BALLVIEW is a bit tricky
since it requires OpenGL (or Mesa) and QT to be installed.  The details of
your local installation have to be passed to configure as command line
arguments. A list of these arguments can be obtained by calling configure with
--help. Please refer to the file INSTALLATION for more detailled instructions.

After building the libraries, please remember to set the shared library search
path (environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to the location of the libraries
(this location is printed after the execution of make install).

Please help us to improve the quality of this library by sending all the
problems you ran into, all criticism, encouragements, improvements, bug
reports, and wishes for further functionality to
