INSTALL:
 1. Download BALL from the BALL website www.ballview.org
 2. Save BALL-1.1.1.tgz and unpack it: tar zxvf BALL-1.1.1.tgz
 2. change into the source directory: cd BALL-1.1.1/source
 3. run ./configure --help to see the options available
 4. run ./configure --disable-VIEW 
 5. make (wait and wait,finally successed)
 6. make install

 If you do not get any errors, you have successfully installed the
 Ball library, which is a requirement for Ligsitecsc. If you have
 problems in compiling BALL, please send e-mail to the BALL
 mailinglist at ball-discuss-l@postino.mpi-sb.mpg.de.

 7. Before running LIGSITEcsc, you have to export the library path of
    BALL. Add the following two lines to your ~/.bashrc file. Replace
    PUT THE BALL DIRECTORY HERE by the appropriate directoy path
    ($BALL: the folder where BALL is installed).
    Replace PUT THE RIGHT DIRECTORY HERE by the folder you find under 
    $BALL/lib/. It is something like Linux-i386-g++_3.3.3(the last 
    three numbers (3.3.3) will be different depending on your system),

    export BALL=PUT THE BALL DIRECTORY HERE
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BALL/lib/PUT THE RIGHT DIRECTORY HERE
	
    To make the updated changes in the bashrc file visible in your
    shell, type in the shell

    source ~/.bashrc

    To verify that your path settings are correct, type in the shell

    ls $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    and you should get as output libBALL.so

 Now we are ready to progress to the installation of LIGSITEcsc

 8. Download lcs.tgz to the $BALL directory
 9. Change into the Ball directoy
    cd $BALL
 10. Unpack the LIGSITE code:
     tar zxvf lcs.tgz
 11. Change into the lcs directory
     cd $BALL/lcs
 11. Type
     make lcs 


Usage of lcs:
lcs -i <pdb_file_name>  [-s grid_space]  [-n number_of_pockets] [-t SSS_threshold] [-d surface_density] 

-i: pdb_file_name, the file name of the protein, no default
-s: grid space, default: 1.0 angstrom
-n: number of pockets,default: 3
-t: SSS_threshold, the threshold for SSS event, from 3 to 7, default: 6
-d: surface density, the density (dots/A^2 ) to calculate the surface vertex, default: 0.5


For example, you want to identify the pockets on "1dwd.pdb", just type 
./lcs -i 1dwd.pdb

you will get three standard pdb files: 
"pocket.pdb", the identified pocket sites in pdb format
"pocket_all.pdb", all the pocket sites in pdb format
"pocket_r.pdb", all the grid points before clustering in pdb format

and one python script file called "pocket.py" to visualize the pocket sites 
using PyMol(http://pymol.sourceforge.net).
If you have pymol on your machine, just type:
pymol pocket.py
