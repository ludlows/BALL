			A class for doing molecular dynamics simulations      
			according to the principle of a canonical ensemble (NVT), i.e., 
			the temperature is kept constant. 
			This is achieved via the velocity rescaling proposed by
			Berendsen et al., J. Chem. Physics, 81:3684, 1984.
			Note that this approach does  not give all properties of a
			true canonical system. In particular, the heat capacity 
			cannot be calculated!	
			\par
			The temperature is set through the \link MDSimulation::setReferenceTemperature \endlink method.
