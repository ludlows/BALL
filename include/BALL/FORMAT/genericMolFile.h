	/**	Base class for all molecule file format classes. 
			This class provides an interface for all molecular
			structure formats (except for PDB files, due to their 
			complex and capricious structure and contents). \par
			GenericMolFile supports two type of operations: 
			reading/writing single molecules and reading/writing 
			systems (i.e. collections of molecules). \par
			When reading molecules, the structures are read one at
			a time from the file in the order they are stored.
			In contrast, reading systems retrieves all structures
			contained in the file. For file formats that do not support
			multiple structure in a file (e.g. the MDL  \link MOLFile MOLFile \endlink ),
			those two operations are basically equivalent.
			A fundamental difference however is the fact that
			reading a molecule <b>  create </b> a new molecule, whereas
			reading a system adds the molecules read to an
			existing instance of  \link System System \endlink . This implies that
			the system has to be cleared prior to reading a system
			if that incremental behaviour is not desired. \par
			The user interface of the class is mainly provided through
			the stream operator. A typical example for reading a structure 
			from a HyperChem file might look as follows: \par
			\begin{verbatim}
				HINFile hinfile(filename);
				System S;
				hinfile >> S;
			\end{verbatim}
			This interface applies to all derived classes as well, so that
			file formats can be exchanged conveniently. \par
			GenericMolFile is derived from  \link LineBasedFile LineBasedFile \endlink  since most
			molecular structure formats are line-based tagged formats,
			often containing Fortran-style formatted sections. 
			 \link LineBasedFile LineBasedFile \endlink  provides a number of convenient methods
			to parse that kind of format.
