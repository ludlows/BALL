		/** Base class for all widgets and dialogs that handles communication through message posting.
				There are methods that handle the registering process between the classes that
				should be connected as well as notifying methods that are responsible for posting
				messages. The registering process will be handled by the interface of every
				dialog and widget. In this process a tree will be created that connects all 
				connectionObject objects.	See ModularWidget for further information concerning
				widget and dialog interface definition.
				The widgets communicate with the help of the method notify_. With this method
				a message can be sent through the connectionObject tree. One connectionObject
				will be the root of this tree and therefore responsible for handling and sending
				all	incoming messages. A Message will first be sent to the root of the connectionObject
				tree and then will travers its way down to every leaf excluding the one that
				had sent the original message. If an incoming message triggers a reply message (in the
				onNotify method) that new message will be stored in a message queue in the root 
				of the tree and executed
				if the first message has traversed all leafs of the tree. Therefore a message should
				always be created with the new command and the flag deletable must be set to <b> true</b>.
				If a message if statically created in the <b> onNotify</b> method there is the possibility
				that the message is already destroyed when it should be processed.
