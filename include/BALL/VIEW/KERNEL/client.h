				objects to the visualization.
				In this version only the one way direction from this client to the
				visualization is possible. In the future there is also a bidirectional
				data exchange intended. If a Composite is sent two times than the 
				graphical representation of the first one will be replaced through the
				new graphical representation of the second one. For example if the structure
				of the Composite is continually changed by a program so the visualization
				of this Composite changes as well.
				The Client class connects to the Server class that is also a part of
				the VIEW library. See Server for further information.
