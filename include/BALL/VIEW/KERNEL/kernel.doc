		a \link BALL::VIEW::Server Server\endlink . The class \link BALL::VIEW::QTTimer QTTimer \endlink 
		is a timer class that is necessary for the
		\link BALL::VIEW::Server Server \endlink class. It queries every given interval whether new
		data from the client is accessable and directs it to the <em>VIEW</em>
		application.
