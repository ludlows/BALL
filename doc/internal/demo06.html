<blockquote>
Defining the <it>surface</it> of a molecule turns out to be a nontrivial
task with no unique solution. Apart from the implications of quantum 
mechanics ("atoms have no boundaries"), different "objects" will
"see" different surfaces for a given molecule.<br>

A Solvent Excluded Surface (SES), which we see here, is defined as
that part of the molecule that would be "visible" to the hull of a water
molecule: the molecule is considered as a union of Van-der-Waals
spheres, over which a water molecule is rolled. The points where
the surface of the water touches the surface of one Van-der-Waals
sphere of the molecule compose the SES.
