This is a Stick model, again visualizing each bond in a given
molecule. In contrast to the Line model, the bonds are drawn
as cylinders with a finite radius, that are closed with a spherical
cap.<br><br>
Similar to the Line model, the Stick model is quite fast, and offers
a clear and simple representation of the molecule without too much
confusing eye-candy.
