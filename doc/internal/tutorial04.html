<h3> Visualisation of trajectories </h3>

<blockquote>
To visualise the resulting trajectory, we will have a look at the 
DatasetControl. It is one of the listviews in the main window and
has the caption "Datasets". 
(Maybe it is hidden, if you don't find it, have a look at the menu
 entry <b>"Windows->Datasets"</b>.)<br><br>
The DatasetControl should have an entry for the trajectory.
To visualise it, click on the entry and open the context menu with
the right mouse button. First choose "<b>Load into RAM</b>" and then 
"<b>Visualise/Export</b>". In the Snapshot Visualisation dialog press "<b>Animate</b>".
