<h3>Hierarchy of molecules</h3>

<blockquote>
After we created the peptide you can have a look at the peptides
hierarchy. In the main window there is a listview with the title
"Structures". This widget contains a hierarchical list of all loaded
molecules. Click the cross to the left of the name of your
newly created protein to open the hierarchy tree. Repeat this
to see, that the peptide clearly consists of four amino acids
(if you entered the sequence correctly).
<br><br>
When you are finished playing around with the hierarchy,
highlight the System by clicking on its name ("ARND").
This will take you to the next step of the demo.
