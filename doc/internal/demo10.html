<blockquote>
Every model can be combined with the 12 different coloring methods.
<br>
<br>
For this example we chose a Van-der-Waals model with coloring 
by temperature factor, where the color of an individual atom
is determined by its flexibility.<br><br>

In the default settings, the colors are interpolated between blue 
(rigid) to yellow (very flexible). If no value can be assigned, the
atom is colored white. The temperature factor data is 
typically derived from crystallographic measurements.<br><br>
The default coloring for this and all other coloring methods
can be changed in the preferences dialog.
