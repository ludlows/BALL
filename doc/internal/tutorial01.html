<h3>Building a peptide from a given sequence</h3>

Welcome to the BALLView tutorial. It will show you some of 
BALLViews main features. The demo is divided in 
several steps, wich have to be finished one by one.
The button "Next" will be enabled after finishing each individual step.
<br>
<br>
We start by building a polypeptide from an aminoacid sequence.
To do so, open the PeptideBuilder dialog by clicking the menu entry
<br>
<b>"Build->BuildPeptide"</b>.
<br>
<br>
Then enter the sequence ARND in the label field at the top. This
will create a polypeptide with the aminosequence
Alanin-&gt;Arginin-&gt;Asparagine-&gt;Aspartic acid. 
<br>
Then press the "<b>Build</b>" button.
