<blockquote>
As a final example for the different coloring schemes, 
we choose a Stick model, colored according to its amino acids, i.e.
all alanines are assigned the same color, and so on.<br><br>
BALLView offers even more coloring methods which you can
explore easily. But at this point, we want to move on to something
more interesting...
<br><br>
When you press Next,  molecular dynamics simulation will start. You can watch 
the structural changes the molecule would undergo in time.
We will perform 30 steps and the current
step number will be shown in the statusbar at the bottom of the main window.
<br><br>
Don't worry if the MD Simulation takes a moment to start.
