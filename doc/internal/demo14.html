<blockquote>
To understand a protein's function, it is often necessary to study
its electrostatic field. This can be easily done using BALLView, where
you can compute the electrostatic potentials in space in an FDPB
setting with just a few mouse clicks.<br><br>
When you press Next, such an FDPB electrostatic computation will
be performed. Depending on the performance of your machine
this might take a moment.
