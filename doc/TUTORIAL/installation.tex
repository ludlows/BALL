\section{System Requirements}

\subsection{Compiler}
\index{compiler}
  BALL requires a (more or less) ANSI compliant \CPP compiler.
  It has been successfully built and tested on the following platforms:
	\begin{itemize}	
   	\item Linux/x86 2.x using g{\tt ++} 3.3.3
%   	\item Linux/x86 2.x using g{\tt ++} 2.95.3
%   	\item Linux/x86 2.x using Kuck \& Associate (KAI) \CPP 4.0
   	\item Linux/x86 2.x using Intel C++ Compiler 8.0
   	\item Solaris/SPARC 8 using g{\tt ++} 3.2.1
%   	\item Solaris/SPARC 8 using g{\tt ++} 2.95.3
%   	\item Solaris/SPARC 8 using Kuck \& Associate (KAI) \CPP 4.0
%   	\item Solaris/SPARC 8 using Sun Forte Developer 7 C{\tt ++} 5.4 2002/03/09
   	\item IRIX 6.5 using CC 7.3.1.1m (32 and 64 bit)
%   	\item Compaq Tru64 Unix V4.0f using Compaq \CPP 6.3
		\item Microsoft Windows XP using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (MSVC 7.0) and Visual Studio Express 2005
 	\end{itemize}

\subsection{BALL on the Windows platform}
For instructions on how to install BALL on the Windows platform, please
have a look at BALL/Windows/README.txt . The sections below will describe
how to build BALL on Unix, Linux and MacOS...

\subsection{External software and libraries}
BALL needs {\tt flex} and {\tt bison} for automatically generating parsers
for various purposes. These utilities are standard software and should be
installed on every contemporary UN*X machine. The newest versions are
downloadable from \URL{http://www.gnu.org/software/}.

The usage of GNU {\tt make} is recommended, although BALL will also build with
other versions of {\tt make}. It is available from \URL{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/}
and easy to install.

The compilation of the visualization component VIEW also requires
the QT library (at least version 3.2), which is available from
\URL{www.trolltech.com/products/qt}/.

If QT was not installed in one of the standard library paths or the
QT header files were not installed in one of the compiler's default
include directories, use \mbox{"\option{--with-qt-libs}{\tt{}=DIR}"} and
\mbox{"\option{--with-qt-incl}{\tt{}=DIR}"} as options to configure (see
Section \ref{section:building-ball}) to specify the paths QT was installed
to.\index{QT} {\tt configure} will also honor the {\tt QTDIR} environment variable.

QT also requires OpenGL. On platforms that do not provide OpenGL, Mesa can
be used. Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is 
very similar to that of OpenGL. It can be obtained from 
\URL{http://www.mesa3d.org}.
\index{MESA}

If your machine has a graphics accelerator from ATI oder NVidia, 
you can use the vendor-provided OpenGL drivers (\URL{http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html}
and \URL{http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux.html}).
But be warned, we experienced serious trouble with both of the drivers. They
still seem to be unstable up to now (February 2004). If you have freezes in
BALLView or display problems in the 3D view, please have a look at our FAQ
which addresses some of the issues
(\URL{http://www.ball-project.org/Support/FAQ}).

To use the Python extensions of BALL (Python is an object oriented
scripting language), you will also need Python (version 2.2 or above) installed
(\URL{http://www.python.org}) and a recent version of SIP (version 4.0rc2 or
above, available at \URL{http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/}). SIP is a tool
for generating Python bindings for C++ class libraries.

Additionally you might need the FFTW package for fast Fourier
transformations (Verson 2.1.3), available from \URL{http://www.fftw.org/}.

Please make sure that the required external \CPP libraries (i.e. QT and SIP)
have been compiled with the same compiler (and compiler version!) as the BALL
libraries. Otherwise you will most likely see a plethora of strange error
messages, either while linking applications or at runtime.

\section{Installation}
\label{section:building-ball}

Building BALL is very easy, but please read through this section carefully to
avoid any problems.  If all requirements stated above are met, BALL is built
by issuing the following commands in the directory {\tt BALL/source}:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  ./configure
  make
\end{lstlisting}

The following sections give further details on the configuration of the library,
on the library files created, how to test the library, and how to build BALL 
applications.

\subsection{Configuring BALL}
\index{configure!usage}

"{\tt configure}" tries to gather as much information on your system as possible and 
then creates the necessary configuration files (\file{config.h},
\file{config.mak}, \file{common.mak}, and \file{Makefile}).
The configuration of BALL may be adapted to your needs and to your system
configuration from the command line by adding one or more of the options from
Table \ref{table:options}.
An overview of these options can also be obtained by executing "{\tt configure
--help}"

	\option{--with-qt}{\tt{}=QTDIR}& QT installation is in QTDIR. This option

                                           \\\vspace{3mm}

  \option{--with-sip-lib}{\tt{}=DIR}&             the SIP library resides in DIR

\caption{options for {\tt configure}}
\label{table:options}
\end{longtable}
%\end{center}
%\caption{options for {\tt configure}}
%\label{table:options}

For example, to compile BALL without the visualization component,
specify 
\begin{lstlisting}{}
  configure --disable-VIEW
\end{lstlisting}

To compile the visualization classes using the QT installation in
/opt/misc/qt, specify the path to the QT directory as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  configure --with-qt=/opt/misc/qt
\end{lstlisting}


If the headers or libraries are installed in non-standard directories, you can
also specify them separately:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  configure --with-qt-libs=/opt/lib 
		--with-qt-incl=/opt/qt/include
\end{lstlisting}

If Mesa should be used (when compiling under Linux), the correct options might look
like this:

\begin{lstlisting}{}	
  configure --with-qt-libs=/opt/qt/lib 
		--with-qt-incl=/opt/qt/include
    --with-opengl-libs=/opt/mesa/lib 
		--with-opengl-incl=/opt/mesa/include
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Building the Libraries}

After the successful termination of configure, issuing "make" will build the
shared libraries. Two different libraries will be built:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
  	\file{libBALL.so}&     the main BALL library\\
  	\file{libVIEW.so}&     the visualization classes\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The latter library is not built if "\option{--disable-VIEW}" is specified or configure
cannot find X libraries, OpenGL libraries, or QT libraries (and the respective headers).

It is also possible (although not recommended) to build the corresponding static libraries
\file{libBALL.a} and \file{libVIEW.a} using "{\tt make
staticlibs}". Please note that statically linked binaries are huge.

\subsection{Installing the Libraries}

After compiling the libraries, they are installed in {\tt BALL/lib/\${BINFMT}/}
when calling "{\tt make install}" where {\tt \${BINFMT}} is the binary format
as determined by {\tt configure}.  Currently, the only way to install the
libraries somewhere else is by moving them by hand to the desired destination.
Wherever you install the shared libraries, please make sure to include their
location in the \Index{{\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}} environment variable.

If you are using \Index{csh}, \Index{tcsh}, or similar shells, use the command
\begin{lstlisting}{}
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH DIR
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent to set the library path. If you are using \Index{sh}, \Index{bash},
or related shells, try

\begin{lstlisting}{}   
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=DIR
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\end{lstlisting}

If you installed the shared libraries in a directory that the dynamic linker
\Index{ld} searches by default, it is not necessary to set {\tt
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}.
